    HOW TO UPGRADE

Overwrite files in include/ and js/ folders with new versions.
Check out config.inc.php for main settings.
Note: config.inc.php is located in top folder.

upgrade to 2.4 to requires following changes:
 1. file mysql-virtual-domains.cf was changed, additional_conditions was appended
 2. table cyrup_domains requires update to set enabled to true:
   UPDATE `cyrup_domains` SET `enabled` = 1;

upgrade to 2.3 brings new defines in config.inc.php
 1. SHOW_VACATION_LIST - to enable parsing of Sieve scripts for vacation. This may slow down UI
 2. SYSTEM_ALIASES - postfix pcre database where system aliases (postmaster|abuse) are stored
 3. DEFAULT_DOMAIN - reflects 'defaultdomain' of cyrus to allow short-name (without domain part) authorization
